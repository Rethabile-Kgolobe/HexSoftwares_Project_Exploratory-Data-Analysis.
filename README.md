# HexSoftwares_Project_Exploratory-Data-Analysis.

## Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values and confirmed that there are none.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Basic statistics were calculated to understand the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Pairplot to visualize data distributions and relationships between features.
   - Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between numerical features.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Findings
- The Setosa species is easily distinguishable based on its short and wide sepals.
- Strong correlations were observed between petal length and petal width.

## Visualizations
- Pairplot showing feature distributions and relationships.
- Heatmap showing correlations between features.
